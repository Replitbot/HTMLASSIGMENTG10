<font color='white' face='verdona' size=6>
Darling, <font color='yellow'>don't move too much</font><br>
<font color='yellow'>Cause you might break the things that you have touched</font><br>
But let me tell you, don't go too far<br>
And just <font color='yellow'>enjoy this artistic room of ours</font><br><br>

This <font color='yellow'>empty canvas, that they misunderstood</font><br>
<font color='yellow'>I wanna paint you in it, but I'm not good</font><br>
'Cause I wanna look at you when we are apart<br>
'Cause you're not just a human being, <font color='yellow'>you are art</font><br><br>

So darling, darling<font color='yellow'> don't be scared</font><br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
Your<font color='yellow'> colors</font> caught my eye<br>
And you're my <font color='yellow'>favorite sight</font> to see<br><br>
It's from the way that you move<br>
And everything that you do<br>
And after that it's when I realize<br>
That <font color='yellow'>I love you</font><br><br>


You told me to look everywhere else<br>
But I said no, 'cause<font color='yellow'> when I look at you</font><br>
<font color='yellow'>My heart always melts</font><br>
So I stayed even though you're a mess<br>
'Cause you're like drugs and with you
<br>
Yeah, I'm obsessed<br><br>

So darling, darling don't be scared<br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
Your colors caught my eye<br>
And you're my <font color='yellow'>favorite sight</font> to see<br><br>
It's from the way that you move<br>
And everything that you do<br>
And after that it's when <font color='yellow'>I realize</font><br>
That <font color='yellow'>I love you</font><br><br>

Darling, darling, don't be scared<br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
<font color='yellow'>Your colors caught my eye</font><br>
<font color='yellow'>And you're my favorite sight to see.</font><br><br>
