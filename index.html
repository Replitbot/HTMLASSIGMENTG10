Darling, don't move too much<br>
'Cause you might break the things that you have touched<br>
But let me tell you, don't go too far<br>
And just enjoy this artistic room of ours<br><br>

This empty canvas, that they misunderstood<br>
I wanna paint you in it, but I'm not good<br>
'Cause I wanna look at you when we are apart<br>
'Cause you're not just a human being, you are art<br><br>

So darling, darling don't be scared<br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
Your colors caught my eye<br>
And you're my favorite sight to see<br><br>

It's from the way that you move<br>
And everything that you do<br>
And after that it's when I realize<br>
That I love you<br><br>


You told me to look everywhere else<br>
But I said no, 'cause when I look at you<br>
My heart always melts<br>
So I stayed even though you're a mess<br>
'Cause you're like drugs and with yous<br>
Yeah, I'm obsessed<br><br>

So darling, darling don't be scared<br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
Your colors caught my eye<br>
And you're my favorite sight to see<br><br>

It's from the way that you move<br>
And everything that you do<br>
And after that it's when I realize<br>
That I love you<br><br>

Darling, darling, don't be scared<br>
'Cause even if I look everywhere<br>
Your colors caught my eye<br>
And you're my favorite sight to see.<br><br>
